            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup warm milk (or water)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (or melted butter)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional, for added flavor)</li>
            <h3>For the Garlic Topping :</h3>
            <li>3-4 cloves garlic (finely minced)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <li><h3>Prepare the dough</h3></li>
            <ul><li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Make a well in the center and add the yogurt, warm milk, and ghee (or melted butter).</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Mix until the dough starts to come together. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until itâ€™s soft and elastic. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 1 hour, or up to 2 hours.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Garlic Topping</h3></li>
            <ul><li>Mix the minced garlic with melted butter. Set aside.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Shaping the naan</h3></li>
            <ul><li>Preheat a skillet or tandoor over medium-high heat.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a golf ball).</li></ul>
            <ul><li>On a floured surface, roll out each ball into a thin oval or round shape. Aim for a thickness of about 1/4 inch.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Cook the Naan</h3></li>
            <ul><li>Place the rolled-out naan onto the hot skillet. Cook for 1-2 minutes until bubbles start to form on the surface.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Flip the naan and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until brown spots appear.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Brush the top with the garlic-butter mixture while the naan is still hot.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Optionally, you can finish cooking the naan under a broiler for a few seconds to get a charred effect, but this step is optional.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3></li>
            <ul><li>Garnish with additional chopped cilantro if desired.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Serve warm with your favorite curry or dish.</li></ul>
        </ol>
